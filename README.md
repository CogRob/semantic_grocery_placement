This repositor is a package to be added in the workspace/src repo avaible here: [Fixturless_fixturiing_place_and_pick](https://github.com/jih189/fixtureless_fixturing_place_and_pick_re-grasping/tree/sim-melodic)
Please download and follow the instructions in the sim-melodic branch the repo above. Then add this repository as a package with in the workspace. 

Install [rail_segmentation](https://github.com/GT-RAIL/rail_segmentation) package to the workspace/src directory created above. Be sure to run catkin_make. 

To test with in the same simulation enviroment, go to the folder simulation fix. ADD the 'scene' folder to workspace/src/fetch_copeliasim/, to replace the scene folder there. Next add the objects_description folder to workspace/src and replace the folder there.
